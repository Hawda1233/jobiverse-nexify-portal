# 3D Models Directory

This directory should contain 3D models used throughout the application.

## Required Models:
- robot.glb - A robot character used in various UI elements
- interviewer.glb - A professional character for the interview simulator

## Important Notes:
1. You need to add your own .glb model files to this directory
2. Download free GLB models from sites like:
   - https://sketchfab.com/ (Many free models available)
   - https://www.turbosquid.com/ (Has free and paid models)
   - https://free3d.com/ (Various free 3D models)

3. Recommended model specifications:
   - Low poly count (under 50k triangles) for better performance
   - T-pose or neutral pose for character models
   - Properly UV mapped and textured
   - Exported as binary GLB format

4. Until you add model files, the application will display simple geometric shapes as placeholders.
